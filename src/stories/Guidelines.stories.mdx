# Guidelines

While components are generally flexible and reusable, they are expected to be typically used in a certain way. This section describes the guidelines for using components.

## General Elements

- Form header elements are generally expected to appear in the order:
  - Header
  - Section
  - Section
- Form header elements should generally be used in longer vertical forms.

## Inputs

- Buttons are flexible and can be used in a variety of ways.
- Input\* elements are fairly self-contained, but are expected to appear within a \<form\> element.
- Input\* elements are currently expected to be used in a vertical form.

## Options

- Options are expected to be used within a \<form\> element.
- Options are expected to be used in a vertical form.
- Treat Option* elements like Input* elements in usage.
- Option\* elements are meant to be nested in container elements like OptionGroup and Option.
- Nesting order may look like:

```md
- Option
  - OptionGroup
    - OptionCheck
    - OptionCheck
    - OptionCheck
  - OptionGroup
    - OptionRadio
    - OptionRadio
    - OptionRadio
```

- Alternatively:

```md
- Option
  - OptionCheck
  - OptionCheck
  - OptionCheck
```

## Data

- Data elements are conceptually expected to be used within a tabular data context.
- They may be used outside of an explicit table element.
