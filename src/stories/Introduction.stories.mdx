# Introduction

PCL (Pinnacle Component Library) is a UI component library written using Svelte, which can be consumed by other Svelte projects in the organization. It is designed to house all reused and potentially reusable components across all of our projects, with the ability to modify styles going forward. The library is aligned with Pinnacle's semver system, where v3.0.0 corresponds to Pinnacle's 2023 event.

Features:

- A collection of reusable, flexible branding-approved UI components
- Easy to update styles for new and old projects
- Versioned using Pinnacle's aligned semver system

## Getting Started

<br />

### Installation

PCL is available as an npm package.

```bash
// with npm
npm install @pinnacleusorg/components

// with yarn
yarn add @pinnacleusorg/components
```

### Usage

PCL is designed to be consumed by other Svelte projects. To use a component, simply import the component you want to use from the package.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { Button } from '@pinnacleusorg/PCL';
</script>
```

Component names directly align to the names presented in the component list in the sidebar.

### Versioning

PCL is versioned using Pinnacle's aligned semver system (major.minor.patch). The major version is aligned with the current year's event (e.g. v3.x.x correlates with Pinnacle 2023) and therefore also that year's branding guidelines. This allows for easy identification of project statuses along with their corresponding event year.
