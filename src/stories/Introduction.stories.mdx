# Introduction to QUISP

QUISP is Pinnacle's internal UI library, featuring shared components used across our services. Common elements like buttons, navigation utilities, and form controls should be shared.

## ^3.0.0

QUISP adheres to Pinnacle's aligned versioning, so v3.0.0 will correspond to v3.0.0 / 2023 versions of other projects.

QUISP 3 uses Pinnacle version 3 branding.
